My career has been an interesting journey. It is still in its early days but I have been exposed enough to the real world of business in general and know what I need to do to progress. During my tertiary studies, we did a project with some colleagues and managed to understand the current system of the Johannesburg Shelter for Displaced People. It opened my eyes in terms of how much data is there to work with and required detailed attention and planning to understand and recommend suitable solutions to the current system they had. I got a job at Foto First which is in the retail industry and learned a few tricks on engaging with customers. Getting to work on their database system and help improve it was interesting. At Elason Security we took on the challenge of setting up a lab from scratch and managed to identify the necessary hardware and software needed to operate the lab successfully, which was a good experience for me as I applied the principles learned during my studies. 

Currently, 

I have engaged with different types of stakeholders which has helped me get the experience in how to communicate effectively. Analysing business processes has been fascinating as you get to see how they work collectively. I have learnt how to look at problems or challenges in pieces which helps in understanding the problem fully. Having been in diffferent projects has helped me to understand that you always have to approach a problem from a neutral point of view and fully understand and be able to illustrate how the solution will bring real value. The experience I have gained is going to make me a better Systems Analyst as my skills keep on growing across the board with each work I get to do. The good thing is I am more than curious enough to understand how systems work and how I can add value. I am still young and there is still a lot to learn for me and I look forward to that journey.
